  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to the 4th World Risk and Insurance Economics Congress (WRIEC). The conference happens only once every five
    years and it combines three separate annual conferences: the American Risk and Insurance Association (<a href="http://aria.org">ARIA</a>), the
    European Group of Risk and Insurance Economists (<a href="http://egrie.org">EGRIE</a>), and the Asia Pacific Risk and Insurance Association (<a href="http://www.scicollege.org.sg/apria.asp">APRIA</a>). The
    host rotates every 5 years and WRIEC 2020 is hosted by ARIA.
  </p>
  <p>
    The in-person meeting of the WRIEC was scheduled for August 2-6 in New York City. Due to Coronavirus, the in-person
    meeting was canceled in late May and the conference is now virtual. This online program allows registered conference participants
    to access papers, videos, slides, and more. There are <a href="/#/p">3 plenaries</a>, <a href="/#/rs">15 research sessions</a>, and <a href="/#/ts">1 teaching session</a>. In
    addition to the recorded content, there are 3 days of live <a href="/#/rf">research forums</a> accessible through Zoom.
